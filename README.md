# Machine-Learning-Codes

In the past three years I've studying machine learning by myself through some books, online courses, videos, conversations and across the internet. After gathering a reasonable knowledge I started participate at some Kaggle's competitions. There are still many things to learn, but in the meantime I want to share with you my little piece of machine learning experience. I hope it is useful.

The following readings were very helpful in my journey through the world of machine learning.

*Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data.* Author: J. VanderPlas<br />
*Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.* Author: Book by Christopher Bishop<br />
*Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms.* Author: David J. C. MacKay<br />
*Deep Learning.* Authors: Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, Francis Bach<br />

For anyone interested in entering this fascinating world I recommend the Stanford's online course [*Machine Learning*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), with Andrew Ng.
