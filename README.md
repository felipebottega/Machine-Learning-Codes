# Machine-Learning-Codes

In the past two years I've studying machine learning by myself through some books, online courses, videos, conversations and across the internet. After gathering a reasonable knowledge I started participate of some Kaggle's competitions. there are still many things to learn, but in the meantime I share with you my little piece of machine learning experience. I hope it is useful.

The following readings were very helpful in my journey through the world of machine learning.

Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data. Author: J. VanderPlas<br />
Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. Author: Book by Christopher Bishop<br />
Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms. Author: David J. C. MacKay<br />
Deep Learning. Authors: Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, Francis Bach<br />

For anyone interested in entering this fascinating world I recommend the Stanford's online course ['Machine Learning'](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), with Andrew Ng.
