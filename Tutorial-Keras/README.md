[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a high level neural network library for Python, capable of running with TensorFlow as backend. Keras is supported by Google's TensorFlow team and is one of the most popular interfaces to work with neural networks at the moment. I did this tutorial for myself several months ago but now I think that some of the tips and examples should be shared with everyone else. This tutorial is a compilation of tutorials from [machinelearningmastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com), with my extra tips, more details at some parts and more examples. This 'personal' tutorial version was very useful to me so I hope that sharing this will be useful for others too.
