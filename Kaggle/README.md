# Machine-Learning-Codes: Kaggle

Below are the links to each Kaggle problem. For a gentle introduction on how to use the tensor techniques showed here (MLSVD and CPD), start reading the digit recognizer notebooks. The tensor package used there is called *Tensor Fox* and can be found [*here*](https://github.com/felipebottega/Tensor-Fox).

Below are the links to the corresponding competitions.
